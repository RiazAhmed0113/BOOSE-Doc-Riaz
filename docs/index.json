Riaz Ahmed group 3 Each element is covered in the weekly sessions, using the BOOSE library source code as an example. I will discuss how I implemented the more difficult elements (like the parser, implementing loops etc.) Keep your progress up to date below. Put \"DONE\" after each section, when you have done it. The number in brackets represents the component that each element contributes to. Checkpoint 1 Version Control (1) (DONE) At least two documented commits to provided on GitHub Classroom BEFORE 12pm 7th October. At least 5 documented commits.

Final Submission 1 Further Version Control (1) You must continue to use VC to a professional standard with frequent and clear commits Your Readme.md must be up to date 2 Use of Interfaces (1) Interfaces to be used for all classes where appropriate 3 Further Unit Testing (1) Tests for full program all of the facilities completed in 5,6 and 7 below It is up to you how design your tests (i.e. one test per facility or one test testing many but they must be clearly documented with XML comments) 4 Design Patterns (1) Use of factory Design Pattern for command creation Use of Singleton Design Pattern Demonstrate the use of another design pattern of your choice (for 5,6 and 7 you can click the links to see the example BOOSE programs that must be run, these are in your Portfolio. You must run the unrestricted programs and replace the image already there with an image of your BOOSE Interpreter running the BOOSE programs.
